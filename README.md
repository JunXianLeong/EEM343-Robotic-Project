# EEM343-Robotic-Project
This is my individual project for course EEM343 Robotic. The project title is Grape Harvesting Dual Robot Arms System. In this project, ROS kinetic is used as the main software to control the robot. Gazebo is used as the simulator to simulate the motion of the robot.
This project has been divided into four tasks. For Task 3,URDF files, ROS control files and any ROS relevant file need to be created to build the basic structure of ROS control system and also build the robot model which is displayed in Gazebo.

Location of Main files:
1) URDF file : /grape_robot_description/urdf/grape_robot.urdf.xacro
2) ROS Control files: i)/grape_robot_gazebo/controller/"controller".yaml
                      ii)grape_robot_moveit_config/controller/"controller".yaml
3) Python file used for trajectory palnning: /grobot_trajectory_planning/src/grobot_commander.py
4) Gazebo models used in simulation: /gazebo_models
5) Object recognition launch file: /grobot_object_recognition_pkg
